# Vast Views Web Application

### Motivation
I began this web application to serve as a good foundation to continually learn how to build modern features. The purpose of it is to allow users to view random nature images from the Unsplash API. Currently, I've added an infinite scroll feature that will fetch images as the user scrolls. This provides an image viewing experience similar to one you would find on a social media application. Additionally, I've added a light and dark theme toggle, and the ability to filter which orientation of images you want to be fetched from the API.
